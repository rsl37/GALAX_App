# GALAX App - Network Requirements Summary

## Document Overview

This directory contains comprehensive firewall and network configuration documentation to resolve connectivity issues affecting the GALAX civic networking platform. The documentation addresses all external service dependencies required for proper application operation.

## Available Documentation

### 1. [FIREWALL_CONFIGURATION.md](FIREWALL_CONFIGURATION.md)
**Primary comprehensive guide** covering all network requirements:
- Complete service categorization (Authentication, API, Telemetry, etc.)
- Detailed URL and domain lists
- Port requirements and protocols
- Implementation guidelines for network administrators
- Troubleshooting procedures
- Environment-specific configurations

### 2. [GITHUB_SERVICES_FIREWALL.md](GITHUB_SERVICES_FIREWALL.md)
**GitHub-specific detailed reference** covering:
- All GitHub service endpoints (API, Actions, Copilot, Security)
- Authentication and OAuth requirements
- Package registry access
- CI/CD pipeline connectivity
- Code scanning and security services
- Testing and validation procedures

### 3. [QUICK_FIREWALL_SETUP.md](QUICK_FIREWALL_SETUP.md)
**Quick reference for immediate implementation**:
- Essential domains for immediate access
- Firewall rule examples for multiple platforms
- Copy-paste configurations for common firewall systems
- Basic troubleshooting commands

## Quick Start

For immediate firewall configuration, allow these critical domains:

### Essential Domains
```
# Core Services
github.com
*.github.com
*.githubusercontent.com
api.github.com

# Package Management
registry.npmjs.org
*.npmjs.org

# Application Services
*.tile.openstreetmap.org
cdnjs.cloudflare.com
```

### Required Ports
```
443/tcp  # HTTPS (Primary)
80/tcp   # HTTP (Redirects)
587/tcp  # SMTP (Email)
22/tcp   # SSH (Git)
```

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Access
1. Configure core GitHub services
2. Enable npm package registry access
3. Allow map tile services

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
1. Configure email services (SMTP)
2. Enable telemetry and monitoring
3. Allow development tools

### Phase 3: Optional Services
1. Configure additional CDN services
2. Enable advanced security features
3. Add monitoring and analytics

## Service Categories

### Authentication Services
- GitHub OAuth and API authentication
- Email verification services
- Token management systems

### API Services
- GitHub REST and GraphQL APIs
- Package registry APIs
- Map and geolocation services

### Telemetry & Monitoring
- GitHub Copilot telemetry
- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking services

### Development Tools
- CI/CD pipeline services
- Code scanning and security
- Package management and distribution

## Network Architecture Considerations

### Corporate Environments
- Proxy server configuration
- SSL/TLS inspection compatibility
- Certificate validation requirements
- DNS resolution dependencies

### Cloud Deployments
- Container network policies
- Service mesh configurations
- Load balancer requirements
- CDN and edge services

### Security Requirements
- Least privilege access principles
- Network segmentation considerations
- Audit and compliance logging
- Encryption and certificate management

## Validation & Testing

### Connectivity Tests
Use the provided test scripts to validate network access:

```bash
# Basic connectivity test
curl -I https://github.com
curl -I https://api.github.com
curl -I https://registry.npmjs.org

# Application-specific tests
npm ping
git ls-remote https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

### Health Monitoring
- Monitor application logs for connection failures
- Set up alerts for blocked network requests
- Track API rate limiting and usage patterns
- Validate certificate expiration and renewal

## Troubleshooting Workflow

1. **Identify the Issue**
   - Check application logs for specific error messages
   - Identify blocked URLs or connection failures
   - Determine affected functionality

2. **Locate Required Services**
   - Refer to appropriate documentation section
   - Find specific domain and port requirements
   - Check for any special configuration needs

3. **Configure Firewall Rules**
   - Use provided firewall configuration examples
   - Test connectivity after rule implementation
   - Validate full application functionality

4. **Monitor and Maintain**
   - Set up ongoing monitoring for connectivity
   - Plan for regular documentation updates
   - Track any new service dependencies

## Support & Maintenance

### Regular Updates
This documentation should be reviewed and updated when:
- New external services are integrated
- API endpoints or domains change
- Security requirements are modified
- Network infrastructure changes

### Getting Help
1. Review application error logs for specific blocked requests
2. Consult the detailed documentation for affected services
3. Use provided testing commands to validate connectivity
4. Check service status pages for external dependencies

### Contributing
To update or improve this documentation:
1. Identify new service dependencies in the codebase
2. Test connectivity requirements in different environments
3. Update the appropriate documentation files
4. Validate changes with network administrators

## Compliance & Security

### Data Privacy
- Review data flow and processing locations
- Ensure compliance with organizational data policies
- Consider geographic restrictions and data sovereignty

### Security Best Practices
- Implement principle of least privilege
- Use encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS) for all services
- Regularly review and audit network access logs
- Maintain up-to-date security patches and configurations
