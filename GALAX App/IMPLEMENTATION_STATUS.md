### 4. API Error Handling - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Basic try-catch exists.
- Missing input validation middleware.
- Rate limiting not everywhere.
- Inconsistent error format.
- Missing security headers.

### 5. Socket.IO Memory Management - BASIC CLEANUP ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Disconnect cleanup exists.
- Missing exponential backoff, max retry, leak prevention, network error handling.

## ‚ùå Still Needs Implementation

### 6. Missing Critical Endpoints
- `PUT /api/user/profile` ‚Äî Profile updates.
- `POST /api/auth/send-email-verification` ‚Äî Email verification.
- `POST /api/auth/verify-email` ‚Äî Email verification.
- `POST /api/auth/send-phone-verification` ‚Äî Phone verification.

### 7. Security Vulnerabilities
- No rate limiting on authentication/voting endpoints.
- Missing input sanitization for XSS prevention.
- No HTTPS enforcement headers.
- File upload security gaps (signature validation, sanitization, virus scanning).
<!-- Added 2025-07-18: File upload security detail -->

### 8. Performance Optimizations
- Missing DB indexes for common queries.
- No connection pooling.
- Frontend render optimizations needed (virtualization, pagination for large lists).
<!-- Added 2025-07-18: Frontend virtualization and pagination -->

### 9. API Response & Error Consistency <!-- Added 2025-07-18: New consistency section -->
- Inconsistent response formats (array, object, message-only).
- No standard error format.
- No pagination metadata in list endpoints.

### 10. Accessibility, Error Boundaries & SEO <!-- Added 2025-07-18: New section -->
- Missing ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.
- No error boundaries in React frontend.
- No meta tags/SEO optimization.

### 11. CORS Preflight & OPTIONS Handling <!-- Added 2025-07-18: New section -->
- CORS config incomplete.
- OPTIONS handling for preflight requests missing.
- Missing exposed headers for custom tokens.
