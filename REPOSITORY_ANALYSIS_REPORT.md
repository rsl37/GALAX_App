## Detailed Analysis Findings

### 1. Merge Conflicts Assessment ❌ **No Issues Found**

**Investigation Methods:**
- Searched for merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
- Checked for `.orig`, `.rej`, and `*CONFLICT*` files
- Examined git status and working tree cleanliness
- Analyzed commit history for merge failures

**Results:**
- ✅ **No merge conflict files detected**
- ✅ **Clean working tree status**
- ✅ **No unresolved conflicts in repository**
- ✅ **All merges completed successfully**

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ find . -name "*.orig" -o -name "*.rej" -o -name "*CONFLICT*"
# No results - clean repository

$ git status --porcelain
# Empty output - no uncommitted changes

$ git fsck --full
Checking objects: 100% (150/150), done.
# Repository integrity verified
```

### 2. Failed Commits Analysis ❌ **No Issues Found**

**Investigation Methods:**
- Analyzed git reflog for incomplete operations
- Searched commit messages for failure indicators
- Examined git fsck output for corruption
- Reviewed all 12 pull requests and their merge history

**Results:**
- ✅ **All commits successfully completed**
- ✅ **No evidence of failed commits in history**
- ✅ **Repository integrity fully intact**
- ✅ **All PRs merged without commit failures**

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ git log --oneline --grep="fail\|error\|conflict\|revert" --all
# No failure-related commit messages found

$ git reflog --oneline -15
003ed6f HEAD@{0}: clone: from https://github.com/rsl37/GALAX_App
# Clean reflog with successful operations
```

### 3. Extra Branches Analysis ✅ **Systematic Development Pattern**

**Investigation Methods:**
- Analyzed current branch structure
