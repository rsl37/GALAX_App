# GALAX - Feature Completion Status
<!-- Updated 2025-07-19 15:56:42 UTC: Current implementation status and feature assessment -->

## üéØ Executive Summary
<!-- Updated 2025-07-19 15:56:42 UTC: Revised completion status -->

**Overall Completion: 65% Alpha Ready, TypeScript Issues Blocking Beta**

### üìù Definitions: Alpha Ready vs Beta Ready

- **Alpha Ready**: Indicates that the core features of the platform are implemented and functional, but the system is not yet stable or complete enough for external testing. Known issues, such as TypeScript compilation errors and security gaps, must be resolved before progressing to the beta stage.
- **Beta Ready**: Signifies that the platform is stable and feature-complete, with all critical issues resolved. At this stage, the system is ready for external testing and feedback, with a focus on identifying and fixing minor bugs and usability issues.
- **Current Status**: The GALAX civic platform has substantial core features implemented but requires critical fixes before beta testing. While the database architecture is excellent (23 tables) and UI is well-developed (6,466+ frontend lines), TypeScript compilation errors and security gaps must be addressed for production readiness.

**Current Metrics (2025-07-19):**
- ‚úÖ Development server functional
- ‚ùå 47 TypeScript compilation errors
- ‚úÖ 23 database tables operational
- ‚úÖ Real-time features working
