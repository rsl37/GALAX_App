- Core authentication and security (100% complete)
- Basic civic platform features (help requests, governance, crisis management)
- Database infrastructure and API foundations
- Real-time communication systems

**❌ NOT Ready for Beta:**
- Production deployment infrastructure
- Advanced user experience features
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring
- Content moderation and community management
- Performance optimizations for scale

### Recommended Action Plan:

1. **Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Critical Issues**
   - Fix root-level deployment configuration
   - Implement React error boundaries
   - Add basic accessibility features
   - Create notification system foundation

2. **Phase 2 (Week 3-4): Important Features**
   - Complete SEO optimization
   - Add enhanced pagination and API features
   - Implement content moderation basics
   - Add performance monitoring

3. **Phase 3 (Beta Testing): Iterative Improvements**
