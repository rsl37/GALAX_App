# Original Merge Conflict Resolution Guide

To stop getting “unable to merge” errors, you need to address the source of the issue, which is usually caused by merge conflicts or non-fast-forward errors. Here’s how to resolve these common issues:

For Merge Conflicts:

1. Identify Conflicts:

• Run git status to check which files are causing conflicts.

• Open the conflicted files in your text editor and look for conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).

2. Resolve Conflicts:

• Edit the files to decide which changes to keep or merge both sets of changes.

• Remove the conflict markers after resolving the conflict.

3. Stage and Commit Changes:

• Stage the resolved files using git add.

• Commit the resolution with a descriptive message: git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict".

4. Continue the Merge Process:

• If you were rebasing, run git rebase --continue.

• If you were merging, you can now finish the merge operation.

For detailed steps, visit Resolving a Merge Conflict Using the Command Line.


For Non-Fast-Forward Errors:

1. Fetch and Merge Remote Changes:

• Run git fetch origin to get updates from the remote repository.

• Merge the updates into your branch with git merge origin/<branch-name>.

2. Push Changes Again:

• After resolving the divergence, push your changes using git push.

Alternatively, you can use git pull origin <branch-name> to fetch and merge in one step. Learn more at Dealing with Non-Fast-Forward Errors.


If you are frequently encountering merge conflicts, consider improving collaboration practices, such as frequent pulls from the remote repository and clear communication with your team about ongoing changes.
