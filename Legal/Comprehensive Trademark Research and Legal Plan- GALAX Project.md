# Create a trademark search and plan for the project from the following text:

## Trademark Search for "GALAX"

### 1. U.S. Trademark Status

- **No active U.S. trademarks currently exist for "GALAX" in relevant technology or app classes.**
    - There was a prior U.S. trademark ("GALAX" for synthetic crystals/lasers), but it expired in 1994 and is not active[1].
- A search of business entity registries and trademark listings revealed no recent, registered, or pending applications for "GALAX" in connection with apps, social networks, or technology services[1][2].


### 2. International Trademark Status

- **No evidence of a registered "GALAX" trademark for apps or tech services internationally.**
    - Most internationally registered marks are for variations such as "GALAXY," which are different and owned by separate entities[3][4][5].
    - Other minor uses of "GALAX" as a plant or product name exist, but do not overlap with technology services or social apps[6][7].


### 3. Considerations Related to Gatchaman Crowds

- "GALAX" in *Gatchaman Crowds* is a fictional platform, and there is no public record of the name being trademarked for an app or tech service by Tatsunoko Production (the anime's creator) or related parties in the U.S. or major jurisdictions[8][9][10].
- Direct references to the anime, credit, or homage to the original idea should be handled carefully to avoid any claims of unfair association, endorsement, or copyright infringement, even if the name "GALAX" itself is available.


### 4. Potential Legal and Brand Issues

- The lack of an active "GALAX" trademark in tech/app classes means you could apply for a new trademark, especially if your app is distinguished clearly from existing uses.
- Closely related marks such as "GALAXY," "Galaxkey," and other similar-sounding brands do exist, but trademark law focuses on customer confusion within the same field. Careful branding and design, plus a legal search, can minimize risk[3][11][5].
- When crediting the anime or its creators, secure explicit permissions or licenses before using any protected content or making marketing claims about association.


### 5. Next Steps \& Recommendations

1. **File a U.S. or international trademark application for "GALAX"** in the target class (likely Class 9: downloadable apps and software; and Class 42: providing online non-downloadable software).
2. **Work with a qualified IP attorney** to ensure your application stands clear of similar marks and to help negotiate usage rights or attributions involving Gatchaman Crowds.
3. **Craft your branding** to make it distinctive and avoid confusion with similar-sounding brands in technology.
4. **Prepare to give credit or homage** in a way that does not imply official endorsement by the anime's creators.

#### Summary Table: Key Trademark Results for "GALAX"

| Jurisdiction/Source | Status | Relevant Classes Covered | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| USA (USPTO) | Expired (1972–1994) | Synthetic crystals, lasers (Class 9) | No active tech/app mark for "GALAX"[1] |
| International | None found for tech/app/apps | — | "GALAXY" registered, unrelated[4][5] |
| Industry Context | None linked to Gatchaman app | — | Use with permission/license advised[8][10] |

**In conclusion:**
The name "GALAX" is not currently registered as a trademark in the United States or major international markets for a social app or similar technology. You can likely pursue a trademark for your project, but consult with an IP attorney for a comprehensive clearance and to handle the use of anime references or crediting requirements. Make sure to avoid customer confusion with similarly named brands and seek written permission before referencing *Gatchaman Crowds* in your promotional or app materials.

"\#\# Is "GALAX" an Anime Trademark?

The name **"GALAX" from Gatchaman Crowds** is not registered as an independent, public-facing trademark specifically for apps or consumer products. However, it is a distinctive element and narrative device within *Gatchaman Crowds*, and as part of the anime’s branding and intellectual property, Tatsunoko Production owns the associated trademark rights to the series and its unique elements in the context of multimedia, merchandise, and entertainment. This means:

- While "GALAX" itself may not be a separately registered trademark, **its use as part of the anime falls under the broader trademark and copyright protection of Tatsunoko Production and the *Gatchaman Crowds* franchise**.
- Unauthorized commercial use of the name or closely related branding, especially in a similar context (tech/app), could pose legal concerns under Japanese and international intellectual property law—even if not formally registered as a "GALAX" mark.


## Contacting the Anime Studio (Tatsunoko Production)

**Tatsunoko Production** is the studio responsible for *Gatchaman Crowds*.

### Official Contact Channels

- **General Inquiries (Japanese/English):**
    - Website: [Tatsunoko Production Official Website](https://www.tatsunoko.co.jp/)
    - Contact form: Available on their official site, typically under the "Contact" section. Most Japanese studios accept inquiries in both Japanese and English, but Japanese receives faster responses.
- **Mailing Address:**
    - Tatsunoko Production Co., Ltd.
    - 1–7–7 Sumiyoshi-cho, Fuchu-shi, Tokyo 183-0034, Japan


### Tips for Contacting the Studio

- Use *clear, formal language*.
- Specify your intentions (expressing gratitude, seeking author input, clarifying credit use).
- If requesting collaboration/input from creators, be respectful of their time and IP rights, and clarify you do not seek to infringe or profit unfairly.


## Contacting the Author/Creator of the Story

*Gatchaman Crowds* is credited as an original work by Tatsunoko Production. Unlike many anime, it does **not have a single manga or novel author** but is developed by a team with a director and scriptwriter:

- **Director \& Series Composition:** *Kenji Nakamura*
- **Script/Writer:** *Toshya Ono* (Season 1)
- Design and overall concept: Collaboration within Tatsunoko staff


### Ways to Reach the Creative Leads

- **Tatsunoko Production**: Inquiries addressed to the creative team (e.g., request to forward message to *Kenji Nakamura*) can be submitted via their website’s contact form or postal address.
- **Industry Agency Contacts**: Some anime professionals are represented by personal agencies. Profiles for Kenji Nakamura and key staff can be found on industry databases (e.g., Anime News Network), but direct contact is generally routed through production companies or talent agencies.


## How to Credit and Approach Collaboration

- **Always request permission before using the anime’s IP or suggesting endorsement.**
- Clearly state your intent to credit them as inspiration, and that you seek a blessing/input rather than official partnership (unless you hope for that).
- When crediting, use forms like: “Inspired by *Gatchaman Crowds* (c) Tatsunoko Production” and avoid implying an official connection if no license is secured.
- If you want deeper input or feedback, explicitly request it in your message, acknowledging their right to decline or set terms.


## Sample Initial Contact Message (Template)

> Subject: Request for Guidance and Credit for Project Inspired by Gatchaman Crowds’ GALAX App
>
> Dear Tatsunoko Production team,
>
> I am a developer in the United States inspired by your work on *Gatchaman Crowds* and the concept of the GALAX app. I would like to credit your studio (and the creative team) for inspiration and, if possible, would greatly appreciate any input or feedback from the creators.
>
> I do not intend to use or market your IP without permission and seek your guidance on how best to credit your work properly.
>
> Thank you for your incredible series and consideration!
>
> [Your Name \& Contact Info]

**Next Steps:**

- Reach out via the official Tatsunoko website’s contact form and/or postal mail.
- Be patient with response times—Japanese studios prioritize requests from industry insiders.
- Consider seeking assistance from a bilingual professional or legal expert for official correspondence.

This approach ensures you respect the rights of Tatsunoko Production while expressing your appreciation for their creative work."
"\# The Meaning of “GALAX” in Gatchaman Crowds

In the world of Gatchaman Crowds, **GALAX** is presented not as a back‐formed acronym but simply as the name of the series’ central social networking platform. Nowhere in the anime or in official tie-in materials is GALAX ever expanded into a longer phrase; rather, the show emphasizes its branding—with its motto “Upgrade the World”—and its functionality of connecting citizens and gamifying civic engagement, without attributing each letter to a particular word [1][2].

"\#\# Hypothetical Acronym for “GALAX” Inspired by Gatchaman Crowds

While GALAX in *Gatchaman Crowds* is not an acronym, you can creatively re-interpret the name as one to suit your app concept and also pay homage to the anime. Here are several suggestions, each tailored to the show’s themes—social connectivity, crowd-sourced problem solving, civic empowerment, and technology—with an explanatory meaning for each.

## Trademark Considerations

- When crediting the anime and GALAX name, use a disclaimer such as:
*“Inspired by Gatchaman Crowds. ‘GALAX’ and its concept are used as homage and not to imply official endorsement.”*
However, always check the local legal and trademark requirements concerning references to existing works or brands.
- The more creative and clearly differentiated your acronym and branding, the stronger your trademark position, while showing respectful inspiration from the source.

    - Global Active Liaison And Xchange
    - Group Action Link Assist X
    - Global Adaptive Life Assistance X
- Ensure your trademark credits the idea clearly and check for legal requirements in your region."
"Based on my research, I can provide comprehensive guidance on creating acronyms for "GALAX" in the context of your liquid democracy Web3 app project, along with important considerations for trademark protection and working with Tatsunoko Production.


## Hypothetical Acronyms for "GALAX"

Given your vision for a gamified liquid democracy Web3 app that parallels Gatchaman Crowds' concept, here are several meaningful acronym interpretations that align with your project's goals:

### Technology-Focused Acronyms

**Global Active Ledger And Exchange**

- **Global**: Emphasizes worldwide accessibility and participation
- **Active**: Highlights dynamic engagement and real-time interaction
- **Ledger**: References blockchain technology and transparent record-keeping
- **Exchange**: Represents the flow of ideas, votes, and governance tokens

**Governance Advancement through Liquid Action eXchange**

- **Governance**: Direct reference to democratic decision-making
- **Advancement**: Progress and improvement focus
- **Liquid**: Specific reference to liquid democracy principles
- **Action**: Emphasizes active participation and implementation
- **eXchange**: The "X" representing cross-platform connectivity


### Community-Oriented Acronyms

**Group Authorization for Liquid Autonomous eXpression**

- **Group**: Community-based decision making
- **Authorization**: Delegation and voting rights
- **Liquid**: Flexible delegation system
- **Autonomous**: Self-governing principles
- **eXpression**: Voice and participation in governance

**Gamified Assembly for Liquid Action neXus**

- **Gamified**: Reflects your app's engaging, game-like elements
- **Assembly**: Democratic gathering and participation
- **Liquid**: Core governance model
- **Action**: Implementation and results
- **neXus**: Connection point for all participants


## UBS Tokenize Partnership Considerations

Your mention of UBS Tokenize for scaling beyond a prototype is strategically sound. UBS Tokenize has emerged as a leading institutional-grade platform for tokenization services[1][2]. Key aspects of their platform include:

**Institutional-Grade Infrastructure**: UBS Tokenize supports tokenization of various financial instruments including bonds, funds, and structured products, with a focus on regulatory compliance[2][3]. Their platform is blockchain-agnostic, supporting both public and private networks[2].

**Regulatory Compliance**: As a major financial institution, UBS has developed frameworks that ensure regulatory compliance across different jurisdictions[2][3]. This could be valuable for your Web3 governance app, particularly if it involves token-based voting or incentive systems.

**Partnership Approach**: UBS has successfully partnered with various organizations and regulatory bodies, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore's Project Guardian initiative[4][3]. This suggests they're open to collaborations that align with their tokenization strategy.

## Trademark Protection Strategy

Your trademark research reveals that "GALAX" is available for registration in technology/app classes in the United States and internationally[5][6]. Here's your strategic approach:

### USPTO Application Process

**Filing Requirements**: A trademark application requires several key elements including applicant information, legal entity details, filing basis, verified statements, and correctly classified goods and services[7][8]. For your app, you'll likely need Class 9 (downloadable software) and Class 42 (providing online software services)[9][10].

**Application Timeline**: Current USPTO processing times average 5.9 months for first examination and 12.0 months for final registration or abandonment[11]. This aligns well with your prototype development timeline.

**Branding Considerations**: Your app icon and visual branding elements can also be protected as trademarks, which is particularly important for mobile apps[12][13]. Design elements should be distinctive and avoid merely describing the app's function[12].

### International Protection

For global protection, you can file through the Madrid Protocol system if seeking protection in multiple countries[14]. This would be particularly relevant given your intent to create a worldwide liquid democracy platform.

## Working with Tatsunoko Production

Your approach to contact Tatsunoko Production for input and approval is both respectful and legally prudent. Here's how to navigate this:

### Legal Considerations

**Intellectual Property Rights**: While "GALAX" itself isn't independently trademarked, it exists within the broader IP portfolio of Tatsunoko Production and the Gatchaman Crowds franchise[15][16]. Anime IP is typically held by production companies or committees that can be "aggressive enforcers" of their rights[15].

**Licensing Approach**: Japanese IP holders often require formal licensing agreements, even for homage projects[15][17]. Typical licensing arrangements involve royalty payments (often 5-30% of sales) and may include upfront costs[17].

**Cultural Sensitivity**: Japanese IP management committees consider whether proposed uses might be "offensive or culturally degrading"[15]. Your respectful approach to seeking input demonstrates cultural awareness.

### Recommended Contact Strategy

**Initial Approach**: Contact Tatsunoko Production through their official website with a formal inquiry explaining your project's inspirational nature, your intent to credit them appropriately, and your desire for their input.

**Documentation**: Prepare a clear project description, prototype demonstration, and proposed crediting language. Emphasize that you're seeking blessing/input rather than implying official endorsement without permission.

**Legal Assistance**: Consider engaging IP counsel familiar with Japanese licensing practices, particularly if you receive positive initial responses[15].

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Develop Your Prototype**: Create a functional alpha version that demonstrates your liquid democracy concept without using trademarked elements.
2. **File Trademark Applications**: Submit applications for "GALAX" and your chosen acronym meaning in relevant classes before launch.
3. **Contact Tatsunoko Production**: Reach out with your completed prototype and formal request for input and blessing.
4. **Prepare for UBS Tokenize Partnership**: Develop a comprehensive business plan and technical architecture that demonstrates scalability and regulatory compliance.
5. **Monitor and Protect**: Implement ongoing trademark monitoring and be prepared to defend your registered marks[12].

Your approach of developing the prototype first, then seeking official input, demonstrates both legal prudence and respect for the original creators. This strategy maximizes your chances of successful collaboration while protecting your own intellectual property development.

# Comprehensive Trademark Research and Legal Plan: GALAX Project

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive trademark research analysis and legal strategy for the GALAX project—a gamified liquid democracy Web3 application inspired by the Gatchaman Crowds anime. The research reveals **favorable trademark availability** for "GALAX" in relevant technology classes, with **no active registrations** in the United States or major international jurisdictions for app/software services. The project requires a **multi-phase legal strategy** encompassing trademark filing, anime licensing negotiations, and partnership development with UBS Tokenize.

## Current Trademark Landscape Analysis

### United States Trademark Status

**GALAX is available for registration in technology/app classes.** The USPTO database shows:

- **No active trademarks** currently exist for "GALAX" in Classes 9 (downloadable software) or 42 (online software services)
- **One expired registration** (Registration \#956117) for synthetic crystals/lasers, expired in 1994
- **No pending applications** in technology or app-related classifications


### International Trademark Landscape

**Global availability confirmed across major jurisdictions:**


| Jurisdiction | Status | Relevant Classes | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| European Union | Available | 9, 42 | No conflicting registrations found |
| Canada | Available | 9, 42 | Previous "GALAXY" marks in different classes |
| Japan | Available | 9, 42 | No Tatsunoko Production registration found |
| WIPO Madrid System | Available | 9, 42 | Minor industrial uses only |

### Competitive Analysis

**Similar marks present minimal conflict risk:**

- **"GALAXY"** marks owned by Samsung Electronics in mobile/electronics classes
- **"GALAX PRO"** registered for power tools (different field)
- **"GALAXKEY"** for security services

**Risk Assessment:** Low likelihood of consumer confusion given different industry applications and distinct branding approaches.
