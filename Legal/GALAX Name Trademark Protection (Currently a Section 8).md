# **GALAX Name Trademark Protection**

The name **GALAX** is protected as a **trademark**, not a copyright. This distinction is crucial for understanding the legal protections surrounding the name.

## **Trademark Registration Details**

**GALAX** is a registered trademark owned by **Galaxy Microsystems Limited** (also known as Galaxy Microsystems Pte. Ltd.)[^1][^2]. The trademark registration includes:

- **Registration Number**: 4823678
- **Serial Number**: 86388943
- **Filing Date**: September 9, 2014
- **Registration Date**: September 29, 2015
- **Status**: 701 - Section 8-Accepted (as of December 14, 2020)[^1]

The trademark specifically covers **graphics cards** and is classified under International Class 009, which encompasses scientific, electrical, photographic, and computer equipment[^1].

## **Company Background and Trademark Evolution**

Galaxy Microsystems was founded in 1994 and originally operated under the name "Galaxytech"[^3][^4]. The company became an NVIDIA AIC (Add-in Card) partner in 1999 and was later acquired by Palit Microsystems in 2008[^5]. In 2013, **Galaxy Microsystems changed its trademark name to GALAX**[^5][^6][^7], unifying its global branding from the previously separate "Galaxy" and "KFA2" brands used in different regions[^6].

## **Copyright vs. Trademark: Key Differences**

It's important to understand why GALAX is protected by trademark rather than copyright:

- **Trademarks** protect brand identifiers like names, logos, and slogans that distinguish products or services in the marketplace[^8][^9]
- **Copyrights** protect original creative works such as literary, artistic, musical, or dramatic works[^8][^9]
- **Trademarks** require registration for legal protection and can be renewed indefinitely[^9]
- **Copyrights** are automatic upon creation and last for the lifetime of the creator plus 70 years[^10]

Since GALAX is a brand name used to identify and distinguish graphics cards and computer hardware products, it falls under trademark protection rather than copyright protection[^11].

## **Current Status and Protection**

The GALAX trademark remains active and provides the company with exclusive rights to use the mark in connection with graphics cards and related computer hardware[^1]. This protection allows Galaxy Microsystems to prevent others from using similar marks that could cause consumer confusion in the same industry[^12].

The trademark has been successfully maintained through required renewal filings, with the most recent Section 8 declaration accepted in December 2020[^1], ensuring continued protection for the GALAX brand name.
