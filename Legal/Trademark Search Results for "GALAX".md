## Gatchaman Crowds and GALAX

Regarding the GALAX app from Gatchaman Crowds:

- **Gatchaman Crowds** is owned by **Tatsunoko Production** (established 1962)[15][16]
- The anime features a social networking app called "GALAX" that serves as a platform for civic engagement[17][18]
- Tatsunoko Production holds numerous copyrights and trademarks for their original works[15][19]
- **No specific trademark registration found** for the GALAX app name from Gatchaman Crowds


## Key Findings for Your Project

### Potential Conflicts:

1. **GALAX** is actively registered by **Galaxy Microsystems Limited** for graphics cards (Class 9 - electronics)
2. **GALAX PRO** is registered for power tools and machinery
3. **Samsung** holds extensive GALAXY-related trademarks for electronics and software applications

### Opportunities:

1. The expired GALAX trademark for synthetic crystals/lasers shows the name has been available before
2. **No direct trademark registration** exists for the GALAX app concept from Gatchaman Crowds
3. Different trademark classes may allow coexistence (e.g., mobile applications vs. graphics cards)

## Recommendations

1. **Trademark Classes**: Consider filing under **Class 9** (computer software/mobile applications) and **Class 42** (software services), which are standard for mobile apps[20][21]
2. **Potential Issues**: The existing GALAX registration by Galaxy Microsystems in Class 9 could pose a conflict for electronics/software applications
3. **Attribution Strategy**: Your plan to credit Gatchaman Crowds and the anime is admirable, but would require permission from **Tatsunoko Production** as the copyright holder
4. **Professional Consultation**: Given the complexity and potential conflicts, especially with Samsung's extensive GALAXY portfolio, consulting with a trademark attorney is strongly recommended

The trademark landscape for "GALAX" shows some existing registrations but potential opportunities in specific application classes, particularly with proper legal guidance and potentially different branding strategies.
