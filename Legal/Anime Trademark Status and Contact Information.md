# It is also an anime trademark right? How do I contact the studio that made the anime and the author of the story? I would like to credit them as thanks and possibly get some of the authorâ€™s input.


# Anime Trademark Status and Contact Information

## Gatchaman Crowds as an Anime Trademark

Yes, **Gatchaman Crowds is protected as an anime trademark and copyright**. The series and its elements, including the GALAX app concept, are **intellectual property of Tatsunoko Production Co., Ltd.**. While my previous search didn't find a specific standalone trademark registration for just "GALAX" from the anime, the entire work including character designs, story elements, and concepts like the GALAX app are protected under **Japanese copyright law and likely registered as trademarks under the broader "Gatchaman" franchise**.

### Original Concept

The series is based on the **original "Gatchaman" franchise created by Tatsunoko Production**, but the specific Gatchaman Crowds iteration and the GALAX app concept were developed under Nakamura's direction.

## How to Contact for Licensing and Permission

### Recommended Approach:

1. **Primary Contact:** Reach out to **Tatsunoko Production's main office** first, as they hold the primary rights
2. **Formal Business Inquiry:** Prepare a formal business proposal including:
    - Your project concept and timeline
    - How you plan to credit the original work
    - Proposed licensing arrangement
    - Commercial vs. non-commercial use details
3. **Language Considerations:**
    - Communications should ideally be in **Japanese** for best results
    - Consider hiring a translator or business intermediary familiar with Japanese business practices
4. **Alternative Channels:**
    - Contact through **Japanese entertainment industry intermediaries** or licensing agents

### Professional Intermediaries

- **Business development firms** that specialize in Japanese anime industry connections


## Important Considerations

### Legal Requirements

- Any use of the GALAX concept or name in connection with Gatchaman Crowds will require **explicit permission** from Tatsunoko Production
- **Attribution alone is not sufficient** - you need formal licensing agreements for commercial use
- The studio may require **royalty payments** or other licensing terms


### Cultural Approach

- Japanese business culture values **formal, respectful communication**
- Initial contact should be **professional and detailed**
- Be prepared for a **lengthy approval process**

Your plan to credit the original creators and seek their input shows excellent respect for intellectual property rights. However, you'll need to go through the proper licensing channels with Tatsunoko Production to use any elements from Gatchaman Crowds, including the GALAX app concept, regardless of whether you're creating something similar rather than identical.
